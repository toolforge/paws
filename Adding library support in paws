Pip is one of the most famous and widely used package management system to install and manage software packages written in Python and found in Python Package Index (PyPI)
pip is the preferred installer program. Starting with Python 3.4, it is included by default with the Python binary installers

#How to install libraries
Downloading a library/package is very easy,while using an interactive shell, tell pip to download the library and install it through the following steps.
1. Go to link https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/PAWS
2. Open a new nottebook
3. Run !pip install tensorflow

If you are working in a notebook rather than an interactive shell, you would typically add something like this to the start of your work to make sure that tensorflow was available:
#Install tensorflow in the current Jupyter kernel

import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install tensorflow

This will either install the package or print something like Requirement already satisfied: colorama in /srv/paws/lib/python3.6/site-
packages. I think the same workflow should reasonably be expected for terminal sessions. Every time you start your terminal you should install the
libraries you will need (probably from a requirements.txt file or something similar). This will either install the libraries or exit gracefully because they are
already installed.

One can also use venv to create a python virtual environment and activate it to not go though the package install each time. 
 See [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html for details)

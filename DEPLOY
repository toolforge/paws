PAWS is deployed to a cloud VPS project.

We are using terraform to deploy the magnum chart. At present we don't seem able to deploy the magnum cluster itself with terraform. So that is done manually:

cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
# type 'yes'

From a cloud control node:
openstack coe cluster create paws --cluster-template paws-k8s21 --master-count 1 --node-count 3

# get kube config
openstack coe cluster config paws --dir /tmp/
cat /tmp/config

Put the output of the above into .kube/config, or somewhere else and export KUBECONFIG=<location> 

cd ../ansible
ansible-playbook paws.yaml

kubectl apply -f manifests/psp.yaml

Update Web Proxies in Horizon. DNS > Web Proxies Point hub-paws and public-paws to the first node of the new cluster 


Dev environment:
pass a datacenter variable to terraform and ansible:
terraform apply -var datacenter=codfw1dev
ansible-playbook paws.yaml --extra-vars "datacenter=codfw1dev"
